# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
## Overview
The rate of cancellation for bookings in the hospitality industry is quite high in the competitive 
market offering no deposit bookings. Once the booking has been cancelled, there is almost 
nothing to be done at the end of hotel. This kind of setting creates discomfort and monetary 
losses for many hotels and creates a demand to take prior precautions for high number of 
cancellations. Therefore, predicting bookings that can be cancelled and preventing these 
cancellations will create value for hospitality industry.
In this project, we will try to explain how future cancelled hotel bookings can be predicted in 
advance with the help of machine learning methods. Also, what measures and steps can be 
implemented for reducing their impact on industry’s revenue.
